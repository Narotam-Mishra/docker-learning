# Difference between Docker Registry and Repository:

- Docker Registry: A Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. It is the server or service (like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or a private registry) that stores multiple repositories.

- Docker Repository: A Docker Repository is a collection of related Docker images (usually for a specific application or service) with different tags (versions). A repository exists within a registry.

# In short:
- Registry = the server/service that stores images.
- Repository = a set of images (with tags) for a specific project within a registry.
